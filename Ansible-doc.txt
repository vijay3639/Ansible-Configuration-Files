Class1: Ansible (Basic Intro & Adhoc Commands)

Ansible - It will come under Configuration Management tool (CM)

What is Configuration Management?
	We have multiple environment in real-time, it is really hard to maintain everything manually; by using configuration tool we can automate the complete process used in the specific Application.
	In Simple Words, If I have Multiple server (20+), client is asking me to Install Apache, Java, and to create a group, user and directories, (Scenario without Configuration tool: I need to do it one by one server, and this consume my time and effort; but by using configuration tool we can automate it just by pushing it from one server to another.

What are different types of CM tools?
	Ansible
	Chef
	Puppet
	Saltstalk, etc.,

Why Ansible?
	For Chef / Puppet I need to know additional scripting knowledge (Groovy / Ruby), But for Ansible Basic Linux commands is more than enough.Ansible automates and simplifies repetitive, complex, and tedious operations. Everybody likes it because it brings huge time savings when we install packages or configure large numbers of servers.Its architecture is simple and effective. It works by connecting to your nodes and pushing small programs to them.
	Ansible works over SSH and doesn't require any daemons (A daemon is a service process that runs in the background and supervises the system or provides functionality to other processes.), special servers, or libraries to work. A text editor and command line tool are usually enough to get your work done.

What is Master-Slave Configuration?
	Master is going to command and Slave is going to work

What are the 2 types of mechanism?
	Push - Pushing the code from Master machine to Slave machine (Ansible)
	Pull   - Pulling the code by login from Slave machine (Chef / Puppet)
Saltstalk supports Both Push and Pull mechanism.

docs.ansible.com - Ansible Official Page - It is a RedHat product.

In Ansible We will call Master as (Control Node), and Slave as (Managed Node).

Ansible is an agentless tools, which means we need to install ansible only on the master machine, and there is no need for installing ansible on the slaves machine.

For all DevOps tools, it is important to know the pre-requisites / requirements before installing the tools.
Ansible Pre-requisites:
1. Python is required on control machine (If it is Python 2, it should be Python 2.7; If it is going to be Python 3, then the version should be Python 3.5 or Higher) [*** Your Control Node should never be a windows one, it can be anything from Linux]
2. Under Managed Node, Python is compulsory (If it is Python 2, it should be Python 2.6 or later; If it is going to be Python 3, then the version should be Python 3.5 or later) [***Managed Node can be windows machine]
	Ansible was writted by Python Language, hence there is a need for Python on all the machines.

What is pip?
Python package Manager

Application we are going here:
1. Putty - SSH terminal
2. Puttygen - Convertor for .pem to .ppk
3. Pagent - Avoid putting .ppk file everytime while login into the machine (we can add multiple .ppk files into it)
4. Visual Studio Code - text editor

What are the 2 important files in Ansible?
	Whenever we are installing Ansible in any OS using installation steps, by default we will get both this files; (***except on pip)
1. Inventory file -------- /etc/ansible/hosts ---------- we will configure all our slaves machine Private IP under this file
2. Configuration file --- /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg ---- this holds all the Ansible configuration details

We are going to cover 4 topics here:
1. ssh Connection --> Ansible master to linux slave connection
1. Adhoc commands - One task at a time
2. Playbooks - Mutiple task (.yaml script)
3. Soap Connection --> Windows Slave Configure
4. Vault - Security layer


Ansible Installation
==============

Bootstrap in Ansible-Master
====================

#! /bin/bash
yum update
yum install python -y
yum install python-pip -y
pip install ansible



vi slaves 

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vijay3639/Ansible-Configuration-Files/main/ansible.cfg

vi ansible.cfg

ansible all -i slave -m ping   -----> To Check Master & Slave Connection 

ansible all -i slave -a "uname -a"  ----> To check OS version

ansible all -i slave -a "uptime" ----> To Check Running Time of an Instance

State:
	1. present/latest = install
	2. absent = uninstall
	3. started = start
	4. stopped = stop
	5. restarted = restart

To install Apache in Slaves
===========================

ansible all -i slave -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present" -b

==================================================================

VAULT:
====== 

- IN PROJECTS, SOME YAML FILES WILL HAVE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OR HIGHLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION. 
- IT CANNOT BE KEPT OPEN. 
- IN SUCH CASES, WE CAN ENCRYPT THE FILES FOR SECURITY.
- IN ANSIBLE VAULT, AESA ALGORITHM IS USED. 
- AESA STANDS FOR ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD ALGORITHM. 
- WE USE 6 COMMANDS UNDER VAULT TO ACHIEVE THIS.
- SIX COMMANDS: CREATE, ENCRYPT, DECRYPT, VIEW, EDIT, REKEY [--ask-vault-pass]

PRACTICAL:
=========

- CONNECT MASTER MACHINE THROUGH PUTTY.
- WE HAVE TWO WAYS TO ENCRYPT YAML FILES. 
- WE CAN USE "CREATE" COMMAND TO DIRECTLY ENCRYPT A YAML FILE WHILE CREATING IT.
- WE CAN ALSO ENCRYPT AN EXISTING YAML FILE BY USING "ENCRYPT" COMMAND.

CREATE COMMAND:
===============

# ansible-vault create first.yml

- hosts: all
  remote_user: ec2-user
  become: yes
  tasks:
   - name: Install git
     yum:
       name: git
       state: present
       update_cache: yes

# cat first.yml
# ANSIBLE VAULT - AES --> ADVANCE ENCRYPTED STANDARD

ENCRYPT COMMAND:
================

THIS METHOD IS USED TO ENCRYPT THE EXISTING YAML FILE.

# vi second.yml
# cat second.yml

- hosts: all
  remote_user: ec2-user
  become: yes
  tasks:
   - name: Install git
     yum:
       name: git
       state: present
       update_cache: yes

- Save it (escape wq!)

TO ENCRYPT THE FILE, USE BELOW COMMAND:
===================================

# ansible-vault encrypt second.yml

TO DECRYPT THE FILE, USE BELOW COMMAND:
===================================

# ansible-vault decrypt second.yml

VIEW COMMAND:
=============

- WE CAN VIEW THE ENCRYPTED FILE USING THIS COMMAND WITHOUT DOING DECRYPTION.

# cat second.yml
# ansible-vault view first.yml

EDIT COMMAND:
=============

- WE CAN EDIT THE ENCRYPTED FILE USING THIS COMMAND. 

# ansible-vault edit first.yml

REKEY COMMAND:
==============

- THIS COMMAND USED TO CHANGE THE PASSWORD OF THE VAULT. AS PER IT COMPANY RULES, WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE PASSWORD OF THE VAULT PASSWORD PERIODICALLY. 

# ansible-vault rekey first.yml

Give vault password:
New Password :
Confirm Password:

TO RUN A ENCRYPTED PLAYBOOK
=========================

# ansible-playbook -i hosts first.yml

# ansible-playbook -i hosts first.yml --ask-vault-pass
